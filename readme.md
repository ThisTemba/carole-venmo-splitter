- The options to pick people is only seen when I click on the item. I would like to see the options alwasy there, before I click on the item.

  - The reason I made these only available when you click is when you have a lot of people then it gets clustered
  - The deeper issue I suppose is that it's unnintuitive to click to see what options are available

- When I click on the example button, it replaced everything I had typed in with the example data. If I saved the file, it would be fine cause I can just load it up again, but if I didn't, then now, I have just lost all the things I typed in.
  - So we need a dialogue that says "Warning, this will replace all your data. Are you sure you want to continue?"
- Maybe add a note section for each event? It might be useful.
  - Notes for events, got it
- I like the color choice of the buttons at the top.
- Everything is pretty simple and self-explanatory. I like it.
- Carole's gonna love it!
