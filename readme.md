- The options to pick people is only seen when I click on the item. I would like to see the options alwasy there, before I click on the item.

  - The reason I made these only available when you click is when you have a lot of people then it gets clustered
  - The deeper issue I suppose is that it's unnintuitive to click to see what options are available

- Maybe add a note section for each event? It might be useful.
  - Notes for events, got it
